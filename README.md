#MOHAI Data App
This app preserves the voices, thoughts and ideas of MOHAI's visitors while simultaneously opening up that data to the community as a whole so it can be talked about and analyzed.

##Use Cases:
- Students & teachers(case: why is this topic important? Show graph.)
- Seattlelites (learn what other Seattlelites are saying)
- Data geeks (because data!)
- Museum visitors (after having interacted with the exhibits, see what other visitors have said)
- MOHAI staff (inform our programming and our exhibit focus by being able to see what topics are popular or trending)

##MVP/Project Domain Model
###User Stories
- As a user I want to be able to see data from the MOHAI exhibits and learn what other users/patrols have said
- As a user I should be able to do some basic filtering on the data visualization and discover things on my own

###Developer Stories
- As a developer I want to implement SMACSS to keep our CSS neat, readable, and easy to fix
- As a developer I want to implement MVC to keep our JQuery organized and readable
